## The Tasks Objective:
I have done completed 4 tasks:
1. Predict whether a bank customer will subscribe to a term deposit as a result of a marketing campaign.
2. Cluster customers based on spending habits and propose marketing strategies tailored to each segment.

## The Approach:
My approach for these 4 tasks included:
   1. Looking if data has missing values, if yes filling those empty cells with relevent values or dopping the respective rows if there are many empty cells.
   2. After that checking for duplicates and removing if the dataset has any.
   3. Then checking for consitency in the format of same values,such as date fromat or spelling, and correcting the formats if required.
   4. loading the dataset and having its info.
   5. Then if task description asks, I trained the model.
   6. To train the model, data was divided in 2 parts training and testing data. Training data is 80% of the entire dataset and testing data is the remaining 20% of the dataset.
   7. Then, feeding the training data to the model and lastly analyzing the model on the basis differnt metircs such as accuracy score, classification report, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error     (RMSE) and other mentioned in the tasks.
